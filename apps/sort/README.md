# SORT APP

> App focuses on Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Design Patterns in Typescript

We want to build a sorting algorithm to sort many types of data structures: Arrays, String, LinkedList.

Sorting Algorithms Example used:

- **Bubble Sort** : iterate and swap. least to greatest

##### NOTES:

- On terminal: `tsc any.ts` will compile `to any.js` file.
- On terminal: `tsc --init` will create **tsconfig.json** file
- `tsc --help` for more info Ex: `tsc -w`,

- **code notes**
- Sorter is an Abstract Class
- We only extending Sorter class and never instantiate it directly

#### Tags

- **Type Guards** (works but bad logic and long)
- **Interface** (better logic). Look for ./assets/sort.png
- **Abstract Class** (best logic) Look for ./assets
